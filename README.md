NEW USER INTERFACE (UI) PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION

Recently at Vanguard, a new user interface has been implemented to optimize user experience. And the A/B test was set into motion from March.15.2017 to June.20.2017. There were two groups to perform this test.

Control group: clients interacted with the traditional online process
Test group: clients interacted with the new digital interface

Both groups navigated through an identical 5 step process.

MAIN GOAL

The goal is to see if the new design leads to a better user experience and higher process completion rates. Which means the main problem statement is “Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?” 

KPI AND FINDINGS

I have used four key performance indicators to determine the success of the new design. The first two are the completion rate and mean total process time. In this case, two hypothesis tests were conducted and statistically proved that the test group showed a higher completion rate than the control group and the mean total process time taken by the test group was less than the control group. 

The rest KPIs are the average time spent on each step and the Error rate. Here also hypothesis tests were conducted and statically proved that the average time spent on each step in the test group was less than the control group. But when we come to the error rate test group has a higher error rate than the control group as we can see here.

Having all these analysis outcomes we can say that the new User Interface encourage more clients to complete the process.

FUTURE WORK

Especially considering the error rate in taste group; I recommend these three aspects for a better decision:

* Give more time for trial
* Get feedback from the users
* Do the tests with more control and test group
